Fly By Night
=============
[Fly By Night April (2013 - )](http://www.melindahetzel.com/fly-by-night.html) takes full advantage of Apples iPhone platform to present an immersive experience. Using Location, Motion, Media and Bluetooth Services along with iBeacon technology, the iPhone becomes both a presentation and a multi-sensor device. Using orientation and position in space provides information on how to present the content within a context. Also taking full advantage of fast multi-streaming video and audio playback, smooth and seamless content can be presented reliably. Quality of content is also presented at the maximum possible quality on the device with ease. Developed side by side with performative elements along with sound design, the app immerses us into a world inside reality.
